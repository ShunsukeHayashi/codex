## 🔄 State Flow (Label-based State Machine)

```
📥 pending → 🔍 analyzing → 🏗️ implementing → 👀 reviewing → ✅ done
      ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
      └─────────────────→ 🔴 blocked/🛑 failed ←────┘
                              ↓
                         (Guardian resolves)
                              ↓
                         🔍 analyzing
```

### State Transition Rules

1. **pending → analyzing**
   - Trigger: CoordinatorAgent assigned
   - Action: Analyze dependencies, complexity

2. **analyzing → implementing**
   - Trigger: Analysis complete, specialists assigned
   - Action: CodeGenAgent/PRAgent start work

3. **implementing → reviewing**
   - Trigger: PR created
   - Action: ReviewAgent starts quality checks

4. **reviewing → done**
   - Trigger: Quality score ≥ 80, PR merged
   - Action: Close Issue, update metrics

5. **ANY → blocked**
   - Trigger: Error, missing dependency, approval needed
   - Action: Escalate to Guardian

6. **ANY → failed**
   - Trigger: Unrecoverable error
   - Action: Log error, escalate

7. **blocked/failed → analyzing**
   - Trigger: Guardian resolved, ready to retry
   - Action: Restart from analysis

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Issue Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create new issue (auto-labeled as pending)
gh issue create --title "Bug: API timeout" --body "..."

# 2. Agent analyzes (auto-update label)
# Labels: 📥 pending → 🔍 analyzing

# 3. Agent starts implementation
# Labels: 🔍 analyzing → 🏗️ implementing, 🤖 agent:codegen

# 4. PR created, review starts
# Labels: 🏗️ implementing → 👀 reviewing, 🤖 agent:review

# 5. Quality score ≥ 80, PR merged
# Labels: 👀 reviewing → ✅ done
# Issue closed
```

### Priority Assignment

```bash
# Critical issue
Labels: 🔥 priority:P0-Critical, 🚨 severity:Sev.1-Critical

# High priority
Labels: ⚠️ priority:P1-High, ⚠️ severity:Sev.2-High

# Medium priority
Labels: 📊 priority:P2-Medium, 📊 severity:Sev.3-Medium

# Low priority
Labels: 📝 priority:P3-Low, 📝 severity:Sev.4-Low
```

### Quality Tracking

```bash
# Excellent quality (90-100)
Labels: ⭐ quality:excellent, ✅ state:done

# Good quality (80-89)
Labels: ✅ quality:good, ✅ state:done

# Needs improvement (60-79)
Labels: ⚠️ quality:needs-improvement, 👀 state:reviewing

# Poor quality (<60)
Labels: 🔴 quality:poor, 🔴 state:blocked
```
