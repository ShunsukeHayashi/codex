  - [ ] Medium: Information disclosure
  - [ ] Low: Minor leaks

- [ ] **Contain the Incident**:
  - [ ] Disable affected systems/features
  - [ ] Revoke compromised credentials
  - [ ] Block malicious IPs/users
  - [ ] Activate circuit breaker (if budget-related)

- [ ] **Notify Stakeholders**:
  - [ ] Security Lead (@ShunsukeHayashi)

  - [ ] Affected users (if applicable)

### Investigation (1-24 hours)

- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - [ ] Review audit logs
  - [ ] Identify attack vector
  - [ ] Determine scope of impact
  - [ ] Document timeline

- [ ] **Evidence Collection**:
  - [ ] Preserve logs
  - [ ] Save system state
  - [ ] Screenshot error messages
  - [ ] Document all findings

### Remediation (24-72 hours)

- [ ] **Develop Fix**:
  - [ ] Create patch/hotfix
  - [ ] Test thoroughly
  - [ ] Review by Security Lead
  - [ ] Prepare deployment plan

- [ ] **Deploy Fix**:
  - [ ] Deploy to staging first
  - [ ] Monitor for issues
  - [ ] Deploy to production
